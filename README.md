> # Why must I yump?
> It's a mish-mash of tiny fun creative services you might like, if you're into that type of thing. Also, those ! blocks won't fill themselves, you know... 

> # Yump me to \[x]...
> Sure — just use yump.me/xxx to yump to its corresponding place! Some yumps might require a password, or for you to nab a Key from someplace else... it's a fun, slightly less efficient take on a standard URL shortener.
